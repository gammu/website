<h2>{% trans "Translating Wammu and Gammu" %}</h2>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
If you know English and some other language, you can just bring Gammu and
Wammu closer to the users who don't know English. Translating process is
really easy and you can just occasionally translate few texts and do not have
to spend much time on it.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<h3>{% trans "Gettext" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
All Gammu, Wammu and this website use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_gettext">gettext</a> framework for
translation of messages in user interface. In addition, Gammu uses gettext
together with <a href="https://po4a.alioth.debian.org/">po4a</a> to translate
documentation. There exists variety of tools which can handle gettext
translations, so you can choose the one which fits your needs.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans "Translating po Files" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Traditional way of doing translations is to download po file, translate it
using some editor (for example <a href="https://www.poedit.net/">Poedit</a>)
and then send updated po file to the author. You can do this when you are
offline, but on the other side, it somehow prevents collaboration.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans "Weblate" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Another option is to use some web based system for translation, where lot of
people can work on single translation as they just translate one text at once.
We currently use <a href="https://weblate.org/">Weblate</a> to
manage translations. To start translating just create an account there and
start translating. You can already see dozens of languages there, but if your
one is missing, just <a href="/support/">tell us</a> and we will add it. There
are separate translations projects:
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gammu/">{% trans "Introduction page" %}</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gammu/wammu/">Wammu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gammu/libgammu/">libGammu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gammu/gammu/">Gammu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gammu/website/">{% trans "This website" %}</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
All languages are open to translated for anybody logged in by default. However
if you want to have better control on some language <a href="/support/">tell
us</a> to allow others only to suggest translations. This usually brings
better quality of translation and slower progress, so it's up to each
translator to define policy.

<h3>{% trans "Hints for Translators" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
In menu items, there is often used ampresand (&amp;), it means keybord
shortcut for menu item. Please make those shortcuts unique in each menu.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Please test the translations in the program. Just download mo file from
translation system and place it under
<code>/usr/share/locale/aa/LC_MESSAGES/wammu.mo</code>, where <code>aa</code>
is two letter code of your translation.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
{% blocktrans with "https://hosted.weblate.org/dictionaries/gammu/" as url %}You should follow terminology as defined for your language in <a href="{{ url }}">dictionary for the project</a>. If it is not defined, you can help creating one!{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans "What is Important?" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
If you will get to translation in bad shape, there is too much work. Use the
following rules to find the most important things:
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<ol>
<li>{% blocktrans %}
libGammu messages - there is just few of them and they are used also in Wammu.
It is just good place to start and get to know some basic terminology.
{% endblocktrans %}</li>
<li>{% blocktrans %}
Wammu translation - the is the application which is most frequently used by
users with little English knowledge.
{% endblocktrans %}</li>
<li>{% blocktrans %}
Gammu translation - it's nice to have but not really a high priority.
{% endblocktrans %}</li>
<li>{% blocktrans %}
Wammu website - there is lot of texts here and it's great to have the website
translated for new users.
{% endblocktrans %}</li>
<li>{% blocktrans %}
Gammu documentation - it would be great to have this translated to many
languages, but it is huge amount of text to translate.
{% endblocktrans %}</li>
</ol>
