Want to use Gammu in your commercial product? As long as you obey license
terms, you are very welcome to do so. The software is licensed under GNU
General Public License version 2 and there is no option to relicense it for
you (basically it is technically impossible to get agreement from all
contributors to change the license).

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
However we can provide you some higher class support for your application.
Should you need something like this, please do not hesitate to contact us
either on some public place like <a href="/support/lists/">mailing lists</a>
or <a href="/support/online/">Jabber or IRC chats</a> or if you do not want to
disclose you project, you can contact directly <a href="/authors/">authors</a>.

We do not provide any fixed price support packages, simply because every
project is really different and it's best to arrange conditions separately to
match everybody needs.
{% endblocktrans %}

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
If you just want to appreciate level of support you got for free, you can also
<a href="/donate/">donate</a> some money to the project.
